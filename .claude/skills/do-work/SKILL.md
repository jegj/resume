# Do Work

Execute a complete unit of work: plan it, build it, validate it, commit it.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the task

Read any referenced plan or PRD that could be a github issue. Explore the codebase to understand the relevant files, patterns, and conventions. If the task is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify scope before proceeding.

### 2. Plan the implementation (optional)

If the task has not already been planned, create a plan for it.

### 3. Implement

Work through the plan step by step.

### 4. Validate

Run the feedback loops and fix any issues. Repeat until both pass cleanly.

```
npm run test
```

### 5. Commit

Once typecheck and tests pass, commit the work.

### 6. Clean up

Once completed. Close the github issue related to the unit of work. DO NOT close the PRD github issue
